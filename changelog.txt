changelog 4.05.0
* MAJOR: The "German" culture has been entirely reworked.
	- Starting with the "Millenium" bookmark and on all Germans will be split into regional variants
	- For bookmarios prior to "Millenium" Germans will start as a mono-culture but diverge over time
	- This process cannot be stopped however an exceptionally strong German emperor that holds uncontested control of the entire region of Germania can attempt to enforce a unified "Imperial German" culture over time
	- These various German sub-cultures will treat each other as different cultures in matters of opinion but are unlikely to want to fracture from a Germanic overlord
	- These changes have also been reflected in the EU4 converter
	- If you do not want this, either in early or late bookmarks, there is a game rule to revert to vanilla Germans from the very start
* Legitimization is now allowed for sibling of a ruler. In this case of legitimization, negative opinion modifier is applied to siblings and children of the ruler.
* Regnal religious names will no longer be given to secular rulers.
* After schism, title history is copied to Ecumenical Patriarch and Papal State.
* The "Shield Maiden" trait (pagan version of Martial Lady) has been renamed to Warrior Woman to avoid confusion with the Shieldmaiden trait added in 2.6. Since they do different things, both will remain.
* Normally in Plus, Aztecs have a very minor chance of appearing. This option was added as a "Reduced" game rule, and is set as default option.
* Streamlined Zoroastrian holy orders: instead of the previous three (one formed by event, two formed by decision, all named some variation of "Immortals") there should now only be one, formed by a decision and expanded by another.
* Plus day-one decisions transfered to game rules.
* Supernatural events are by default turned OFF.
* Crusades/GHWs now prioritize targeting the person who actually holds the target kingdom title (unless the title has no holder or is held by someone of the crusading religion). This prevents having a kingdom title usurped out from underneath a non-participant in the crusade.
* Added titular kingdoms for Assyrians and Kurds and a titular Assyrian Empire.
