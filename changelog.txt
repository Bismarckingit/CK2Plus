changelog 4.05.3

ADDITIONS:
	* Added an option in 'Game Rules' to start with all Pagans reformed. This option is listed under 'Pagan Reformation'
	* Old Plus Tyranny removed in one of the 4.04 versions is back. Tyranny is again represented with traits, not opinion modifiers. In addition, Tyranny trait system is now compatible with Conclave DLC.
	* When empire autodestruct mechanic triggers, non-zealous, christian or pagan rulers can choose to convert to, in ERE/LE case, majority religion of Constantinople, or in HRE case, majority religion of their capital (if that capital has correct religion). This option will only be availble to ERE/LE rulers if they control Constantinople. HRE rulers must have their capital in one of the HRE regions: Frisia, Germany, Lotharingia, Pomerania, Poland, Bohemia or France.
	* Rulers who convert will get Recently Converted character modifier resulting with religion opinion +5, other religion group opinion -10 and 0.5 increase in monthly piety.
TWEAKS:
	* Entirely disabled Seduce Character plot for owners of Way of Life DLC (previously it was available to non-playable characters even with Way of Life) now that the Seduce decision has been made available for lustful characters regardless of focus.
	* WoL business focus events slightly tweaked. Build events require a certain starting fund, but might cost a little bit more. Potential income is also slightly higher.
	* Added a start up option for CK2+ games converted into EU4. You are now given the option to reveal the map as it was displayed in CK2. Most notable this was an issue for nations with a capital not within Europe, as those with a capital outside of it can end up with owned provinces surrounded by 'terra incognita' for the first few decades of a converted game.
	* Aztec religion head, once appointed can call for a great holy war. After that Aztecs will lose Invasion CB.
	* In later game starts (after 1150) some rulers of certain cultures and high enough legalism will switch from gavelkind to primogeniture, or from elective gavelkind to elective.
	* Spouse will be prevented from recommending councillors for 7 years if rejected.
	* Only foreign kings and emperors, and domestic powerful vassals will RSVP for coronation.
	* AI rulers will be more likely to switch to primogeniture or seniority as their legalism tech level rises.
	* Adopt Feudalism decision is now also available if ruler has Medium Tribal Organisation, and legalism, majesty and noble customs atleast at level 3.
	* If ERE/HRE/LE autodestruct event triggers and ruler doesn't convert, old title history will be copied to new title.
	* Hellenic heresies will no longer trigger ERE auto-destruct event.
