changelog 4.05.3

ADDITIONS:
	* Added an option in 'Game Rules' to start with all Pagans reformed. This option is listed under 'Pagan Reformation'
TWEAKS:
	* Entirely disabled Seduce Character plot for owners of Way of Life DLC (previously it was available to non-playable characters even with Way of Life) now that the Seduce decision has been made available for lustful characters regardless of focus.
	* WoL bussines focus events slightly tweaked. Build events require a certain starting fund, but might cost a little bit more. Potential income is also slightly higher.
	* Added a start up option for CK2+ games converted into EU4. You are now given the option to reveal the map as it was displayed in CK2. Most notable this was an issue for nations with a capital not within Europe, as those with a capital outside of it can end up with owned provinces surrounded by 'terra incognita' for the first few decades of a converted game.
FIXED:
    * Nordic/Scandinavian et al. cultures now properly get Elective Gavelkind.
	* ALL cultures now have castle cultural buildings.
	* Indolent child bribe event chain won't fire if child doesn't have any money.
	* Female councillor event chain won't fire if ruler has lifetime appointment law.
	* NWO event setup allowing patrician player to cause game over.
	* Prisoner instigating challenge with an insult.
	* Some patricians not being able to trigger NWO events.
	* Fixed Aztecs not having Invasion CB.
	* Fixed a bug preventing the EU4C from converting CK2 countries to their proper government rank in EU4
