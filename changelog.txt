changelog 4.05.0

* Legitimization is now allowed for sibling of a ruler. In this case of legitimization, negative opinion modifier is applied to siblings and children of the ruler.
* Regnal religious names will no longer be given to secular rulers
* After schism, title history is copied to Ecumenical Patriarch and Papal State
* The "Shield Maiden" trait (pagan version of Martial Lady) has been renamed to Warrior Woman to avoid confusion with the Shieldmaiden trait added in 2.6. Since they do different things, both will remain.
* Plus Aztecs added to game rules. By default game will use vanilla Aztecs, option used in Plus is called "Reduced".
* Streamlined Zoroastrian holy orders: instead of the previous three (one formed by event, two formed by decision, all named some variation of "Immortals") there should now only be one, formed by a decision and expanded by another.
